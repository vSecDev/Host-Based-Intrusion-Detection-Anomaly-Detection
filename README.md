#MSc Computer Science Final Project (WIP)
- Implementation of an extensible anomaly-based classifier consisting of the main HIDS framework, a Data Source module and a Decision Engine module.
- The Decision Engine module provides an implementation of Sparse Markov Transducers used for establishing a baseline for normal system behaviour and classification of previously unseen call traces. (https://noble.gs.washington.edu/papers/smt.pdf)
- The classifier may be evaluated using the ADFA datasets: https://github.com/verazuo/a-labelled-version-of-the-ADFA-LD-dataset )
